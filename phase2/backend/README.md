# Computer Network Phase 2 Project
In phase 1 project, we've demo a project using python to build a GET method for browser to load index.html, which is the frontend structure. Therefore, in this work, I'm using react as the frontend for simplicity, and focus the points on building the api that works on the frontend.

I wrote some accounts and passwords to `account.csv`. \
{Account: 'Linus', passwd: 'apple'} \
{Account: 'apple', passwd: 'banana'} \

Notice that the password is hashed in `account.csv`
